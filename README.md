## Key features of the project include:

- **Adaptive Layout:** The website is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop screens.
- **JavaScript Features:** Interactive elements and dynamic functionalities are implemented using JavaScript to enhance the user experience and engagement.
- **Complex Styling System:** The project features an organized and scalable file structure for styles, utilizing SCSS to keep the styles modular and maintainable.

## Requirements

- The "Live Sass Compiler" extension is highly recommended for compiling SCSS files into CSS directly in VSCode. This extension automatically compiles SCSS to CSS every time you save the SCSS file.
